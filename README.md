# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}


This is a blogging platform created in Kotlin that keeps track of user accounts, posts, and rebuttals to posts.
The goal is to create a functioning login and password system using a Set, allow users to create posts, and then allow users to give responses agreeing with or debating with other posts.

The purpose of the software is to provide a place for people to share their thoughts in essays and then allow others to refute them while providing sources, much like a real debate.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work
- Make a file that I can save a database to after each user session so I don't have to load them in manually for a demo.
- Create a writing feature that allows users to write their entries within the platform.
- Make the process for finding a post to refute easier.
