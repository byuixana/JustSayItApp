# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Kotlin language.}
This is a blogging platform created in Kotlin that keeps track of user accounts, posts, and responses (comments and rebuttals) to posts.
The goal is to create a functioning login and password system using a Set, allow users to create posts, and then allow users to give responses agreeing with or debating with other posts.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wanted to practice using sets and keeping track of user data.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
